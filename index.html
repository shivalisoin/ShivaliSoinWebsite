        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> My name is Shivali Soin and I am a Business Administration student at The University of California, Riverside. I have taken classes such as Micro and Macro Economics, Calculus for Business, two Computer Science classes, Creative Writing, and Psychology. I am on track to graduate early, in about 2.75 years total, and join the workforce while earning an MBA. I'm also an alumna of Mission San Jose High School which is ranked number 12 in California according to US News and Reports. I have taken many various AP and Honors courses and participated in DECA, a competitive business club as well as a few other clubs. I had above a 4.1 GPA the past three semesters of my high school career. I graduated in June of 2019 and began attending UC Riverside in the fall of 2019. After being on the Dean's List for two out of two quarters and receiving an acceptance letter to be part of the Unversity Honors Program at UC Riverside, I decided to drive my focus into academics even further and applied to be a Supplemental Instruction Leader for the Academic Resource Center at my university. I hope to make a difference with this job both in my community and at my university by helping and interacting with my peers as well as instilling a passion for learning. Some subjects I plan on teaching include Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, and Psychology. During my time at the University of California, Riverside I want to get involved with business organizations and clubs to form deep connections and make an impact. My most recent GPA was a 4.0 and I have been on the Dean's Honor list two out of two times so far. My Major GPA is also a 4.0.

I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area, surrounded by a fast-paced, continuously evolving environment. This was both inspiring and challenging. While it was hard to keep up with the high-pressure environment, I gained an unbeatable work ethic, strategies for managing time and keeping the quality of my work high. I learned how to balance school and life and not let myself become burnt out. Learning to relax and give myself the breaks I need has helped me thrive in college and prepared me to drive ahead with full force and be incredibly motivated. I am really interested in gaining some work experience in the field right as I graduate with my Bachelor's of Science, and I would like to be working towards an MBA at the same time. 

I am a hard worker and determined to do my best and put my all into anything I start. My volunteer and work experience has made me a great team player and leader, I work well alone as well as with a team. I am adaptable, compatible, and flexible. My skills include public speaking, communication,Â time management, being a quick learner, being knowledgeable in the use ofÂ many computer programsÂ (eg. Microsoft Office,Â Photoshop, GoogleÂ Suite Applications, HTML, CSS).
